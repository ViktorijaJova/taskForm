Folder Structure
The project structure includes the following components:

Buttons: Reusable button components for the form navigation.
Blocks: UI blocks used to structure the form steps.
Form: The main form component, which handles the logic for the two-step form, validation, and state management.
The form consists of two steps:

Step 1: Collects user details (e.g., name, email).
Step 2: Collects phone information.
Back Button: A button allows users to return to Step 1. The state is preserved when navigating between the steps.
Validation: Each field has client-side validation, and the user receives feedback on missing or incorrect information.
State is managed within the form component using Reactâ€™s useState hook, and the form state is preserved even when navigating back and forth between the steps.


Testing
Form Validation: Test the form by entering valid and invalid values for each field. Ensure that validation feedback is displayed when required.
Responsiveness: Resize the browser to verify that the form is responsive on different screen sizes.
 Accessibility
The form includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility. 

Testing
Fill out the form fields and test the validation:

Names must contain only letters and spaces.

Phone numbers must be between 7 and 15 digits.

Use the "Back" button to navigate between steps and ensure the state is preserved.
