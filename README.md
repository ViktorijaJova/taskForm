Folder Structure
The project structure includes the following components:

Buttons: Reusable button components for the form navigation.
Blocks: UI blocks used to structure the form steps.
Form: The main form component, which handles the logic for the two-step form, validation, and state management.
The form consists of two steps:

Step 1: Collects user details (e.g., name, email).
Step 2: Collects phone information.
Back Button: A button allows users to return to Step 1. The state is preserved when navigating between the steps.
Validation: Each field has client-side validation, and the user receives feedback on missing or incorrect information.
State is managed within the form component using Reactâ€™s useState hook, and the form state is preserved even when navigating back and forth between the steps.


Testing
Form Validation: Test the form by entering valid and invalid values for each field. Ensure that validation feedback is displayed when required.
Responsiveness: Resize the browser to verify that the form is responsive on different screen sizes.
 Accessibility
The form includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
